## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

60 percent

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

To be honest I learned coding probably by actually with the assist of Chatgpt. It helps me correct codes and point out why I am wrong.
This way I start to learn how to code without the help of it with pattern recognition

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

I dont really know. I was too focused on the destination I missed the journey.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

Not so much

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

I like the way how it is. But it would be better if the lecturer provide more exam assisting files

I dont know what I did well but I do know that I learn new plenty of stuffs.
